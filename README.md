# Golang DDD Archetype

:sparkles: This is a template that aims to be simple, complete, flexible and configurable for a golang project.

The main objective of this project is to provide a ready-to-use template that respects and follows the principles and patterns of domain-driven design. At the same time, we want to be able to implement good practices in the development and structuring of projects made with Golang.

## About the project

Currently, in my work there is an archetype built for microservices in Golang, which aims to be a template that contains the main technologies that are handled within the company, Rest, gRPC, Kafka, Mongo, GraphQL, SQL, etc.. However, several factors in its creation make it very complex to use and understand, so it does not facilitate the development process.

This project is created with the idea of offering the same functionalities as the company's archetype, serving as a guide with best practice examples and ensuring robustness in development. It is expected that a developer without so much knowledge can learn and develop on the project in a simple way, as well as a developer with more advanced knowledge can adjust it to their needs.

:white_check_mark: I hope it is useful and that you learn something new, feel free to contribute, suggest or make any comment that will help to improve the project. Thank you!

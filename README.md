# Golang DDD Archetype

:sparkles: This is a template that aims to be simple, complete, flexible and configurable for a golang project.

The main objective of this project is to provide a ready-to-use template that respects and follows the principles and patterns of domain-driven design. At the same time, we want to be able to implement good practices in the development and structuring of projects made with Golang.
